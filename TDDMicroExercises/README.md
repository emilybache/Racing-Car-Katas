# TDD micro-exercises

## Instructions

Here follow these 4 distinct projects. They could be code you inherited from a legacy code-base. Now you want to write unit tests for these projects:

1. **TirePressureMonitoringSystem exercise**:  write the unit tests for the Alarm class, refactor the code as much as you need to make the class testable
1. **UnicodeFileToHtmTextConverter exercise**: write the unit tests for the UnicodeFileToHtmTextConverter class, refactor the code as much as you need to make the class testable
1. **TelemetrySystem exercise**: write the unit tests for the TelemetryDiagnosticControls class, refactor the code as much as you need to make the class testable
1. **TicketDispenser exercise**: write the unit tests for the TicketDispenser, refactor the code as much as you need to make the class testable

Apply the unit testing style you are more comfortable with. You can choose to use stub or mock or not at all. If you do, you are free to use the mocking tool that you prefer. Do the same for the unit testing framework.

## A possible solution

Here you find one of the possible solutions for the exercise: [proposed solution.] (https://github.com/lucaminudel/TDDwithMockObjectsAndDesignPrinciples/tree/master/TDDMicroExercises.ProposedSolution)
