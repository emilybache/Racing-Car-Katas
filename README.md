# Racing Car Katas

In this repository you'll find starting code for five distinct problems. They
could be code you inherited from a legacy code-base. Now you want to write unit
tests for them, and that is harder than it needs to be. All of the code snippets
fail to follow one or more of the SOLID principles.

For each exercise, you should identify which SOLID principles are not being
followed by the code. There is only one class you are interested in writing
tests for right now. As a first step, try to get some kind of test in place
before you change the class at all. If the tests are hard to write, is that
because of the problems with SOLID principles?

When you have some kind of test to lean on, refactor the code and make it
testable. Take care when refactoring not to alter the functionality, or change
interfaces which other client code may rely on. (Imagine there is client code in
another repository that you can't see right now). Add more tests to cover the
functionality of the particular class you've been asked to get under test.

Apply the unit testing style and framework you are most comfortable with. You
can choose to use stubs or mocks or none at all. If you do, you are free to use
the mocking tool that you prefer.

1. **TirePressureMonitoringSystem exercise**: write the unit tests for the Alarm
   class. The Alarm class is designed to monitor tire pressure and set an alarm
   if the pressure falls outside of the expected range. The Sensor class
   provided for the exercise fakes the behaviour of a real tire sensor,
   providing random but realistic values.

2. **UnicodeFileToHtmlTextConverter exercise**: write the unit tests for the
   UnicodeFileToHtmlTextConverter class. The UnicodeFileToHtmlTextConverter
   class is designed to reformat a plain text file for display in a browser. For
   the Python and Java versions, there is an additional class
   "HtmlPagesConverter" which is slightly harder to get under test. It not only
   converts text in a file to html, it also supports pagination. It's meant as a
   follow up exercise.

3. **TicketDispenser exercise**: write the unit tests for the TicketDispenser.
   The TicketDispenser class is designed to be used to manage a queuing system
   in a shop. There may be more than one ticket dispenser but the same ticket
   should not be issued to two different customers.

4. **TelemetrySystem exercise**: write the unit tests for the
   TelemetryDiagnosticControls class. The responsibility of the
   TelemetryDiagnosticControls class is to establish a connection to the
   telemetry server (through the TelemetryClient), send a diagnostic request and
   successfully receive the response that contains the diagnostic info. The
   TelemetryClient class provided for the exercise fakes the behaviour of the
   real TelemetryClient class, and can respond with either the diagnostic
   information or a random sequence. The real TelemetryClient class would
   connect and communicate with the telemetry server via tcp/ip.

5. **Leaderboard exercise**: (note this exercise is still being developed) Write
   the unit tests for the Leaderboard class, including races with self driving
   cars. The Leaderboard calculates driver points and rankings based on results
   from a number of races.

## TDD with Mock Objects: Design Principles and Emerging Properties

This was originally a fork of Luca Minudel's repo. He was using it for a study
of TDD and Design principles. I am using it as a repository for storing
exercises useful for people wishing to improve their skills with TDD and SOLID
principles. Please look at my blog post
["SOLID principles and TDD"](http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2012/09/solid-principles-and-tdd/)
for background reading, or my book
["The Coding Dojo Handbook"](http://leanpub.com/codingdojohandbook).

- When you've had a go at these exercises yourself, you could look at the
  [proposed solutions](https://github.com/lucaminudel/TDDwithMockObjectsAndDesignPrinciples/tree/master/TDDMicroExercises.ProposedSolution)
  in C#, Java, Javascript. If you've done the exercises in Python, you might be
  interested in my blog post
  ["SOLID exercises in Python"](http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2012/09/solid-exercises-in-python/).

- For background reading about Luca's study, see the
  [paper](https://github.com/lucaminudel/TDDwithMockObjectsAndDesignPrinciples/blob/master/Paper/mockobjects_emergingproperties.pdf?raw=true)
  and the

  from Luca's own repo.
